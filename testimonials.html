            “After graduating university, I found that I was looking for a technical application to the theoretical approaches I had already developed. Although at times, I would work late nights in order to complete assignments, I feel comfortable with the new skill set I've acquired and I've already been offered many great opportunities to explore interactive multimedia in the workforce.”

            “After getting my diploma in Graphic Design, I knew there was more to web than I knew. That's why I took the one year interactive multimedia graduate program. I wanted something intensive, where I could learn how to make and manage websites on my own. It also helped that it was offered as a 1 year course. In the end I am overly satisfied with my decision of doing one more year of school”

            “The Interactive Multimedia program as a whole offers the latest in techniques, and ways to consider things, beyond a certain version or brand of software. I found 8 months back at college, updating and expanding some skills with newer tools and more information, a really worthwhile investment. I'm looking forward to continuing growth well beyond the classroom.”
